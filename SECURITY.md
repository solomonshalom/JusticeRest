# Security Policy

Hi!

This is a good place to start if you have found any vulnerability issues associated w/ Bublr or it's packages (weapons üó°Ô∏è) and want to either report it / fix it through a `PR`. Currently, we only have one massive
security issue, this can be found [here](https://github.com/solomonshalom/Bublr/issues/4) or if your feeling on not taking short-cuts, it's avaibale in the issues tab.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability, be it low or high, please open a issue w/ the label `security` or if you found a vulnerability but also know how to fix it, please open a `PR` w/ the `security-fix` label.
If you have found a vulnerability that is far-greater than that is expected, please report it directly to me [at] [security@bublr.life](security@bublr.life)
